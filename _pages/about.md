<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a master student at Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, advised by [Prof. Yu Jiang](https://sites.google.com/site/jiangyu198964/home). I am proud to be a member of the [Software System Security Assurance Group - WingTecher Lab](http://wingtecher.com/homeen). Previously, I received my bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity from Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.

<!-- I am interested in the intersection of data, security and system, with a focus on program analysis, malware analysis and mitigation, data and privacy protection, fuzzing, and IoT security.  -->
I am interested in the intersection of data, security, and systems. To understand and mitigate evolving computer security threats, I work to design and develop practical security tools to detect and defend against a wide range of vulnerabilities in software and systems, e.g., attack investigation (S&P'23, ICSE'24), detection (ICCCN'21, IP&M 2022), and defense (EMSOFT'22, NDSS'25-UnderReview). 

<!-- My research journey explores both established and emerging domains, aiming to contribute to the broader field of computer security through innovative solutions. -->

<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->

Outside of research, I enjoy table tennis, running, livehouse bands performance, science fictions, and fantacy novels.

<span style="color:#ff0000;word-break: break-all;">I am applying to Ph.D. programs for 2025 fall. I would appreciate any information you can [provide](https://forms.gle/AePyPfaubzpnghCS6)!</span>
